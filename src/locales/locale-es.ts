// Every text in the English localization file should have a comment above
// it explaining the context in which it is used. This will help translators to
// more accurately translate and localize the application.

// Just showing `"support": "support"` is rather ambiguous to a translator.
// Depending on where this translation is used within the application it could
// have different meanings.

// Eg: A button with the text "support" could provide support to a customer, or
// it could request support from an employee / administrator. These functions
// are obvious from within the application, however not so when just looking at
// this localization file. In some other languages these two different
// functions could require a different text.

// Style conventions:
//  - Leave at least 8 new lines between sections in this locale file, to
//     make manual searching easier.
//  - Always use double quotes, to make manual conversion to json easier
//  - Each section should be preceded by a comment stating the section
//     name in square brackets ie: [], to make searching for sections
//     easier. eg: Ctrl+f [ Orders ] (without spaces) will go to the
//     section, and not to any text in the translation or in the
//     comments.

// Naming conventions:
//  - heading
//  - placeholder
//  - noResults
//  - fail
//  - columns
